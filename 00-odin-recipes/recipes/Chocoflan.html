 <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocoflan, often called "the impossible cake," is a popular Mexican dessert that combines two beloved treats in one. It features a layer of rich, moist chocolate cake topped with creamy, caramel-infused flan, creating a striking two-tone presentation. The magic happens during baking, where the layers switch places due to the difference in density, with the flan rising to the top and the chocolate cake settling beneath. Finished with a drizzle of caramel sauce, offering a decent balance of textures and flavors.</p>
